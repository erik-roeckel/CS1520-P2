Additional comments to the grader:

My program runs without any error. However, because of what happened to me with the last project I just tried
cloning my git repository onto my desktop to test my program. All of the funtionality for the program still works
however none of the styling and formatting that I included is showing up on my desktop. When I extensivley tested
it on my laptop this was never a problem. I am not sure why this is happening. I ensured that both my computers
have the latest version of chrome installed. Just to see if the formatting was working in any other browsers I ran
my program in firefox on my desktop and all of the formatting displayed as expected. I am really confused as to why
my styling isn't showing up when running my program in chrome on my desktop. I figured I should let you know about this. Thanks
After testing this out a little bit more I figured out that I for some reason had to force restart chrome to get the styles to appear.
I don't understand why this is the case.

Also, I couldn't figure out how to display flashes as light red rather than light blue 
when some sort of error occurs (i.e. customer enters invalid username). Therefore,
the flash messages appear light blue in all instances.
